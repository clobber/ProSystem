ProSystem is an emulator for the Windows operating system that will allow you to play Atari 7800 video games on your PC. An emulator is a program that has the ability to imitate another program, device, or computer. The ProSystem emulator imitates the Atari 7800's CPU, video, audio, joystick controls, etc. Before you can use the emulator, you will need to obtain rom images that are compatible with the Atari 7800. The rom images are the actual data that is loaded into the emulator which allows you to play the game. The rom images can be downloaded from various sources on the internet. Please don't ask me for rom images.<BR>
<BR>
The ProSystem emulator was written in the C/C++ language and uses the Windows API and DirectX to help emulate the display, sound and input. It emulates both the NTSC and PAL consoles. Please see the documentation for a description of the other features.<BR>

The Display menu allows you to set the display properties of the emulator like the display mode, zoom and stretch, and window mode. You can also set the custom palette or default palette and take snapshots of the current display.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Setting fullscreen mode</B><BR>
You can set the emulator to display graphics in fullscreen mode by going to the display sub-menu (in the <A HREF="Options.htm">options</A> menu) and selecting the Fullscreen menu item or use the shortcut <FONT COLOR=green><B>Ctrl+F</B></FONT>. You can also choose which display mode is used in the fullscreen window by going to the modes sub-menu in the display menu and select one of the display modes (all fullscreen display modes use 8 bpp). The display mode will change immediately after selecting the menu-item if you are in the fullscreen mode, otherwise the display mode will be displayed when you change to the fullscreen mode. The default display mode is 640x480x8. You can also choose to stretch the display so that it fills the entire screen by selecting the Stretched menu item from the display sub-menu. A check mark will be next to the display mode, stretched and fullscreen menu items indicating the current selection.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Setting window mode</B><BR>
The window mode is the default mode. You can switch to window mode if you are in fullscreen mode by going to the display sub-menu and selecting the fullscreen menu item or use the shortcut <FONT COLOR=green><B>Ctrl+F</B></FONT>. Display modes and the stretching option have no effect in window mode, but can be selected so that the changes take effect when you choose to go to fullscreen mode. You can also set the zoom level of the window by going to the display sub-menu and choosing the x1, x2, x3, or x4 menu item. This will set how much the window is resized in respect to the display dimensions. A check mark will be next to the zoom menu item indicating the zoom level chosen.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Using palettes</B><BR>
You can choose to use a custom palette or default palette by going to the display sub-menu and selecting the palette menu item. The Palette dialog box will be displayed, which will allow you to select the target palette file to be loaded. If a palette file has already been loaded, it will be displayed in the Palette dialog box. Navigate to the palette file and select the Open button. If you want to use the default palette instead of a custom palette, you can select the default button in the dialog box.<BR>

Palette files have a size of 768 bytes. Each collection of 3 bytes define the RGB color. The C++ code to create the palette would look like the following:<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">
struct rgb {<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;unsigned char r;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;unsigned char g;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;unsigned char b;<BR>
}<BR>
<BR>
rgb palette[255] = {...}<BR>
</FONT>
<BR>
<B>Taking screen snapshots</B><BR>
You can take snapshots of the screen by going to the display sub-menu and selecting the snapshot menu item or use the shortcut <FONT COLOR=green><B>Ctrl+C</B></FONT>. The snapshots are saved as bitmap files. A file dialog box will be displayed that will allow you to choose where the target .bmp file will be saved. Select the OK button to save the snapshot to the target file.<BR>

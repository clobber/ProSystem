Revision history:

Version 1.3f (2015/09/06) - JnO, from enhancements by raz0red
-------------------------------------------------------------
Back-ported some of the enhancements made by raz0red in his wii port (wii7800 v0.3) of the emulator:
- Increased accuracy of Maria cycle timing, games now run at close to their intended speed (One on One, Tower Toppler, Summer Games, KLAX, Karateka, etc.)
- Increased compatibility for PAL games (Ballblazer, Commando, and Food Fight now work)    
- Timers now properly take into consideration cycles generated via Maria and during WSYNC
- Changes to ProSystem database format
    - Maria cycles are now enabled by default (option 0x1 now disables
      Maria, the opposite of before)
    - Ability to set HBLANK period
- All games now have Maria cycles and WSYNC enabled in the ProSystem database (with the exception of MIA)    
- Emulation for the following games was improved: 
    - Kung Fu Master no longer has the lines in the upper left corner of
      display and the Fuji logo appears as it should (if using BIOS)
    - Midnight Mutants has less graphical glitches
    - Summer Games has less graphical glitches
    - Plutos has slightly less graphical glitches
- Fixed save/restore state issue for games that use RIOT timers.  


Version 1.3e (2009/06/04) - Greg DeMent
---------------------------------------
Improved emulation of RIOT's SWCHA and SWCHB ports	(riot.cpp)
Implemented the RIOT's DRA and DRB registers.  Stores to SWCHA/SWCHB now land here.
1/2 button modes are now toggled correctly (fixes 1.3d control bug in Fatal Run, Hat Trick, One on One, Water Ski)
Value of SWCHA now reflects the interactions of CTLSWA and the RIOT's DRA register. Ditto for SWCHB.
This makes behavior of console switches more accurate in odd scenarios (it's possible to lock them active)
Thanks to raz0red and groovybee for their help figuring these things out
Reposted 2009/06/06 to fix:
	version number (was reporting 1.3d2)
	missing call to riot_SetDRA() in the memory_Write switch block
	riot_Reset() wasn't resetting DRA and DRB


Version 1.3d2 (2009/04/15) - Greg DeMent
----------------------------------------
Fixed bug in 1.3d, which had caused player 2 button to be permanently held down.

Version 1.3d (2009/04/02) - Greg DeMent
---------------------------------------
2nd button now works correctly in Dark Chambers
Joystick button emulation is now much more accurate
- Distinct 1 button and 2 button joystick modes are now properly emulated (riot.cpp)
- SWCHB is now writable allowing games to toggle the button mode (memory.cpp)
- SWCHB default settings match testing on real console.


Version 1.3c (2009/03/25) - Greg DeMent
---------------------------------------
minor update to handling of window position:
- FIXED: emulator window now opens in previously saved position, not 0,0 (console.cpp)
- changed default window position to (120, 120) instead of upper left corner. (configuration.cpp)
	This prevents menu and title bar from appearing underneath some taskbar setups.


Version 1.3b (2009/03/20) - Greg DeMent
---------------------------------------
minor changes to controller input:
Controller button 1 is now mapped as the left button, button 2 is the right. (Riot.cpp)
Default keyboard settings for buttons 1/2 edited to match this change. (Input.cpp)
FIXED: right button was not activating the legacy 2600 button signal (Riot.cpp)
added changelog.txt


Version 1.3a (2008/12/24) - Leonis
---------------------------------------
Now, emulator itself calculate MD5 checksum, and write it to "ProSystem.log"
Modified snapshot engine - screenshots now save to directory "\snap"

---------------------------------------

Updated palette
Sample rate property/configuration fixed
Other optimizations
